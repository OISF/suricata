# For FreeBSD ipfw(8) divert(4) support.
# Please make sure you have ipfw_load="YES" and ipdivert_load="YES"
# in /etc/loader.conf or kldload'ing the appropriate kernel modules.
# Additionally, you need to have an ipfw rule for the engine to see
# the packets from ipfw.  For Example:
#
#   ipfw add 100 divert 8000 ip from any to any
#
# The 8000 above should be the same number you passed on the command
# line, i.e. -d 8000
#
ipfw:

  # Reinject packets at the specified ipfw rule number.  This config
  # option is the ipfw rule number AT WHICH rule processing continues
  # in the ipfw processing system after the engine has finished
  # inspecting the packet for acceptance.  If no rule number is specified,
  # accepted packets are reinjected at the divert rule which they entered
  # and IPFW rule processing continues.  No check is done to verify
  # this will rule makes sense so care must be taken to avoid loops in ipfw.
  #
  ## The following example tells the engine to reinject packets
  # back into the ipfw firewall AT rule number 5500:
  #
  # ipfw-reinjection-rule-number: 5500

# Set the default rule path here to search for the files.
# if not set, it will look at the current working dir
