# Number of packets allowed to be processed simultaneously.  Default is a
# conservative 1024. A higher number will make sure CPU's/CPU cores will be
# more easily kept busy, but may negatively impact caching.
#
# If you are using the CUDA pattern matcher (mpm-algo: ac-cuda), different rules
# apply. In that case try something like 60000 or more. This is because the CUDA
# pattern matcher buffers and scans as many packets as possible in parallel.
#max-pending-packets: 1024

# Runmode the engine should use. Please check --list-runmodes to get the available
# runmodes for each packet acquisition method. Defaults to "autofp" (auto flow pinned
# load balancing).
#runmode: autofp

# Specifies the kind of flow load balancer used by the flow pinned autofp mode.
#
# Supported schedulers are:
#
# round-robin       - Flows assigned to threads in a round robin fashion.
# active-packets    - Flows assigned to threads that have the lowest number of
#                     unprocessed packets (default).
# hash              - Flow alloted usihng the address hash. More of a random
#                     technique. Was the default in Suricata 1.2.1 and older.

# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determine the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At the startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get a better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine need to
# prune before unsetting the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing to create new flows, but
# prunning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doens't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more agressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the last time seen flows
# not in use.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's
# in bytes.

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determine the seconds to wait after a hanshake or
# stream startup before the engine free the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if it spend that amount
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero).
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency-" and work similar as the normal ones.
# Some timeouts doesn't apply to all the protocols, like "closed", for udp and

# Please make sure you have ipfw_load="YES" and ipdivert_load="YES"
# in /etc/loader.conf or kldload'ing the appropriate kernel modules.
# Additionally, you need to have an ipfw rule for the engine to see
# the packets from ipfw.  For Example:
#
#   ipfw add 100 divert 8000 ip from any to any
#
# The 8000 above should be the same number you passed on the command
# line, i.e. -d 8000

  # accepted packets are reinjected at the divert rule which they entered
  # and IPFW rule processing continues.  No check is done to verify
  # this will rule makes sense so care must be taken to avoid loops in ipfw.
