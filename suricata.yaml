# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash_size determine the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At the startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get a better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determine the seconds to wait after a hanshake or
# stream startup before the engine free the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if it spend that amount
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero).
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency_" and work similar as the normal ones.
# Some timeouts doesn't apply to all the protocols, like "closed", for udp and
# icmp.
