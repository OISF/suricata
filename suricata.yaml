# At the startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get a better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency_recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine need to
# prune before unsetting the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing to create new flows, but
# prunning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune prune_flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doens't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more agressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the last time seen flows

# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero).
