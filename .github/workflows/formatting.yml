      # Checking out the branch is not as simple as "checking out".
      #
      # In case master has any new commits since we branched off, github will
      # automatically add a "merge commit" from our branch to master and check
      # this out instead of the original last commit on the branch.
      #
      # This screws up git clang-format as it'll also format the "merge commit"
      # and essentially report any formatting issues in the "merge commit".
      # However, we really don't care about any of the new commits on master.
      #
      # There are supposed to be ways to use with/ref to fix that and while
      # they work perfectly well for pull requests within the forked repo, none
      # of the ones tried worked for pull requests from forks to the OISF repo.
      #
      # My patience simply ran too short to keep on looking. See follow-on
      # action to manually fix this up.
