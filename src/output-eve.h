/**
 * \brief Structure used to define an EVE output file type plugin.
 *
 * EVE filetypes implement an object with a file-like interface and
 * are used to output EVE log records to files, syslog, or
 * database. They can be built-in such as the syslog (see
 * SyslogInitialize()) and nullsink (see NullLogInitialize()) outputs,
 * registered by a library user or dynamically loaded as a plugin.
 *
 * The life cycle of an EVE filetype is:
 *   - Init: called once for each EVE instance using this filetype
 *   - ThreadInit: called once for each output thread
 *   - Write: called for each log record
 *   - ThreadInit: called once for each output thread on exit
 *   - Deinit: called once for each EVE instance using this filetype on exit
 *
 * Examples:
 * - built-in syslog: \ref src/output-eve-syslog.c
 * - built-in nullsink: \ref src/output-eve-null.c
 * - example plugin: \ref examples/plugins/c-json-filetype/filetype.c
 *
 * ### Multi-Threaded Note:
 *
 * The EVE logging system can be configured by the Suricata user to
 * run in threaded or non-threaded modes. In the default non-threaded
 * mode, ThreadInit will only be called once and the filetype does not
 * need to be concerned with threads.
 *
 * However, in **threaded** mode, ThreadInit will be called multiple
 * times and the filetype needs to be thread aware and thread-safe. If
 * utilizing a unique resource such as a file for each thread then you
 * may be naturally thread safe. However, if sharing a single file
 * handle across all threads then your filetype will have to take care
 * of locking, etc.
