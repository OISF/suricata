These scripts are used to auto-generate the YAML configuration file for
suricata, containing the list of known TLS ciphersuites and parameters.

The first script (extract-iana-ciphers.py) fetches the list from the IANA website
(https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xml), and tries
to convert it to a CSV file. The names and parameters of ciphersuites are
normalized, to ensure some consistency in the resulting values.

.. note:: The format of the XML file provided by IANA has a lot of small
  inconsistencies, especially in the values separated by underscores in names.
  For this reasons, the scripts have to apply many workarounds, and will
  probably need to be updated for every new version of the XML file.
  The mapping between openssl ciphersuites names, and IANA names, is also
  defined in these scripts.

The second script (convert_ciphers_to_yaml.py) takes the output from the
previous script, and converts it to the YAML format expected by suricata.

The execution of the scripts is done as follows::

 ./extract-iana-ciphers.py
 ./convert_ciphers_to_yaml.py < tls-ciphersuites.txt > tls-ciphersuites.yaml
